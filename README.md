Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

<h5>Input</h5>

The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters â€” the user name. This string contains at most *100* letters.

<h5>Output</h5>

If it is a female by our hero's method, print `"CHAT WITH HER!"` (without the quotes), otherwise, print `"IGNORE HIM!"` (without the quotes).

<h5>Example 1</h5>

<h6>Input</h6>

>wjmzbmr

<h6>Output</h6>

>CHAT WITH HER!

<h5>Example 2</h5>

<h6>Input</h6>

>xiaodao

<h6>Output</h6>

>IGNORE HIM!

<h5>Example 3</h5>

<h6>Input</h6>

>sevenkplus

<h6>Output</h6>

>CHAT WITH HER!

### Note
Note
For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in `"wjmzbmr"`. These characters are: `"w", "j", "m", "z", "b", "r"`. So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print `"CHAT WITH HER!"`.
